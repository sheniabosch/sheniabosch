## Featured Projects 💻

Get ready to see some data magic! My program at WBS Coding School is all about hands-on learning, and these upcoming projects are where I put theory into practice. Each one is a step closer to becoming a data wizard! ✨

### 💼 Case Study: Moosic (Expected: September 2025)

![Moosic Logo](https://learn.wbscodingschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/moosic_logo.webp)

**Moosic** is my deep dive into the world of music and data! This project tackles the challenge of **automating playlist creation for a booming start-up using Spotify's audio features.** I'll be exploring various **clustering algorithms** (think K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering) to organize songs into meaningful "mood" or "style" clusters. The goal? To see if data science can reveal surprising connections between songs, perhaps even outperforming human curation! This project showcases my ability to **apply unsupervised learning to real-world problems** and evaluate different algorithmic approaches.

### 💼 Case Study: Predicting House Prices (Expected: October 2025)

![Selling Home](https://learn.wbscodingschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/selling-home.webp)

In **Predicting House Prices**, I'm stepping into the shoes of a real estate consultant. My mission is to build a **predictive model** that accurately estimates house values based on around 80 different property features. This project is all about mastering **regression analysis**, handling complex datasets, and ensuring unbiased, efficient property valuations. It's a journey into making data-driven decisions that could impact buying and selling strategies for real estate clients!

### 💼 Case Study: Clean Skies London (Expected: November 2025)

![Clean Skies London](https://learn.wbscodingschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2025-04-30-at-13.57.36-1.webp)

**Clean Skies London** is where data meets environmental impact! I'll be working with historical air quality data (NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5) to **build time series models that predict future pollution levels** in this iconic city. This project will challenge me to understand trends, seasonality, and anomalies in environmental data, exploring both classical models like ARIMA and advanced machine learning methods. My findings will aim to help policymakers make timely decisions for cleaner air and a better quality of life for Londoners. Breathe easy! 🌬️

### 💼 Case Study: Learning your ABC’s (Expected: December 2025)

![Sign Language Dataset](https://learn.wbscodingschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dataset-card-1-1024x1024.png)

Time to get hands-on (literally!) with **Learning your ABC's**! This exciting project involves training a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize hand signs for the letters A, B, and C in German Sign Language (DGS)**. I'll be collecting and labeling my own dataset of hand images, building the CNN from scratch, and training it for image recognition. This project is all about building intuition in **computer vision and neural networks**, one letter at a time! ✋🅰️🅱️©️

### 💉 Final Capstone Project: AI Tattoo Healing Companion (Expected: Jan/Feb 2026)

<img width="496" height="415" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-29 at 13 02 57" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b6d0cc5-8e84-4f8b-806f-eac6a57bb2f4" />


For my **final capstone project**, I'm combining my healthcare background with cutting-edge AI! I'm designing an **AI-powered app that scans user-input photos of new tattoos to assess their healing progress and identify potential infection risks.** This predictive model will utilize both image analysis and user input on aftercare and environment. The app aims to provide real-time communication between the client and their tattoo artist, guiding the client through a safe and successful healing journey. This project will leverage **predictive modeling, computer vision, and user-friendly interface design** to make a tangible difference in post-tattoo care!
